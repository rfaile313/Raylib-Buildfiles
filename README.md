# Raylib-Buildfiles

## [Simple-Raylib-Makefile](https://github.com/rfaile313/Raylib-Buildfiles/blob/master/Makefile)

### A simple Makefile that you can include in your [Raylib](https://www.raylib.com/) projects to easily build or clean your project. Simple and clear directions:

1. Ensure you have compiled raylib and generated the `libraylib.a` static file. Need to do this? I have created a [YouTube video guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPDLTQ4J_zQ) that will show you how step by step.
2. Modify the paths in the Makefile to point to your source file(s), and the directory that contains `raylib.h` and `libraylib.a`.
3. `make` to build your program.
4. `make clean` to clean the executable and any objects if they exist.
